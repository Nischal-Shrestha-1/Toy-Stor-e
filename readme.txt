== Design Principles ==

- Proximity: Form labels are placed close to their corresponding imput field.
- Contrast: For dark background I have used brighter text. When I have to use darker text I use a brighter container.
- Made button have brighter contrast to make it stand out.
- Typography: Used consistant font for heading, sub-heading and paragraoh. Styled font-size according to screen size too.

== Accessibility Stratergy == 

For this project I have used alt text that is informative for images so that people with visible disabilty can understand. It can also come in handy if the image is broken.

== Search Engine Optimization Stratergies ==

1. Keywords: I have added keywords on meta tags, headers and content for every page for SEO optimization.
2. Mobile First Approach: Used mobile first approach for all the pages when styling in the website.
3. Internal Linking: Added links in About Us page that redirects to a relavent page outside the website.
