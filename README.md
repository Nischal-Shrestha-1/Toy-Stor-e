== Design Principles ==

- Proximity: Form labels are placed close to their corresponding imput field.
- Contrast: For dark background I have used brighter text. When I have to use darker text I use a brighter container.
- Made button have brighter contrast to make it stand out.
- Typography: Used consistant font for heading, sub-heading and paragraoh. Styled font-size according to screen size too.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Accessibility Stratergy ==

1. For this project I have used alt text that is informative for images so that people with visible disabilty can understand. It can also come in handy if the image is broken.
2. Used media queries and flexible layouts to ensure your site is usable on various devices with mobile first approach.
3. All form controls have associated 'label' elements.
4. Use of relative units like em, rem for font sizes to support user preferences.

== Search Engine Optimization Stratergies == 

1. Keywords: I have added keywords on meta tags, headers and content for every page for SEO optimization.
2. Mobile First Approach: Used mobile first approach for all the pages when styling in the website.
3. Internal Linking: Added links in About Us page that redirects to a relavent page outside the website.
